    <h1>Learning Outcome 4: Biology Concepts</h1>
    <!-- complexity & organization, cells, structure & function, classification, evolutionary change, unity & diversity, inheritance, reproduction, development, life stages, regulation & feedback, physiology & mechanism, homeostasis, interdependence, interactions -->
    <p>Biology concepts focus on our own understanding of the principles that govern life and its processes. The first piece of my work is a drawing, and description of the interactions between roses and rose galls as well as the structure and function of the rose galls. The second is an explanation of the organization of flower petals and how it helps with reproduction. And the final piece is a quick dive into the differences between taxonomic and functional classifications.</p>
