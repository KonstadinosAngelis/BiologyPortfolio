    <p>Science connections link our scientific knowledge to broader aspects of society and culture. To show my grappling with the subject, I've collected 3 quiz questions. The first is on my opinion on the globally necessary scientific value of having as many diverse perspectives as possible both for the health and the effectiveness of the subject. The second is about the importance of the early naturalist Carl Linnaeus' work, and the impact he had in regards to the process of classification. The third is about the increase in public understanding and curiosity when the H.M.S challenger found life in the ocean.</p>
