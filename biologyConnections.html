    <h1>Learning Outcome 6: Biology Connections</h1>
    <!-- lifelong learning plans, techniques, trips & destinations, informal education (museums, libraries, galleries), everyday science, kitchen science, garden science, science & local communities, citizen science, contemporary naturalists  -->
    <p>Biology connections are our personal links to the study of life, and our everyday experiences as we attempt to be lifelong learners. I have two projects that demonstrate personal connections I have made. The first is a lifelong bucket list I want to take up and try to finish. It involves a couple collections, many trips I wouldn't otherwise take, and participation in local communities and citizen science endeavors I wouldn't be as interested in without a larger goal. The second piece is the seven steps technique, which is a pretty quick and easy everyday science tool I can take wherever I go into nature to better synthesis and get a basic understanding of an area I am in.</p>

        <p class="caption">The 7-steps technique is a really nice tool to have in every day life, as it only takes a couple minutes and is agnostic to the environment you are in. I feel it really gets your eyes focused on the right kinds of things to look for ecology and cool quirks of nature in an area. </p>
