    <h1>Learning Outcome 5: Biology Skills</h1>
    <!-- observations, inferences, creativity & imagination, research design, library research, qualitative & quantitative, data collection, sampling, data management, data analysis, data visualization, synthesis & conclusions -->
    <p>Biology skills are the tools and methods which we use to understand and study living organisms and the means with which they function. To show my proficiency in this I have collected a quadrat sampling I took, alongside with data of what I found in the sample, and a pie chart to help visualize it. Along with this I have a response on why sampling is a good tool, what it's limitations are, and where it should and shouldn't be applied.</p>
