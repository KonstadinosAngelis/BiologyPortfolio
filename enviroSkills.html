    <h1>Learning Outcome 8: Environmental Biology Skills</h1>
    <!-- safety (lab & field), field kits, equipment, field techniques, tracking, organism care, collecting & transporting specimens, reading tests & imagery, microscope analysis, self-analysis -->
    <p>Environmental biology skills are practical abilities we can use to study ecosystems effectively while also protecting them. Some skills I developed in order to widen my skill set and safety is how to make a field kit, and a safety checklist. Both of these are important in preparation and engaging in safe trips out to the field. Giving me well defined precautions and all the equipment I should need to handle a variety of scenarios whether expected or unexpected.</p>
