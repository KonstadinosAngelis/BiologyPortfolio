    <h1>Learning Outcome 1: Science Concepts</h1>
    <!-- Perception, evidence, prediction, cause & effect, scale, quantity, continuity, change, matter, energy, patterns, systems & models, specimens, collections, tentative & durable, hypotheses, facts, theories, laws, science history, science fields -->
    <p>The concepts of science are our foundational ideas and practices that help us understand and learn more about the world. Some of the parts I enjoyed learning about the most include my pressed leaf specimen, predicting how latitudes and rain shadow affect climate and vegetation growth, and a hypothetical where I predict the cause & effect of an exploratory study.</p>
