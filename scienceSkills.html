    <h1>Learning Outcome 2: Science Skills</h1>
    <!-- discovery (exploration, description, & explanation), reasoning, analysis, decision making, problem solving, reflecting, recording, note-taking, long-term studies & narration, science study skills, habits, practices -->
    <p>Science skills are the abilities and practical techniques one has in their toolbox to enable effective exploration, understanding and application of our scientific knowledge. I've selected two media pieces, that express ones I've picked up through the class. The first is a model by which scientific discovery can be broken down into it's 3 parts (exploration, description & explanation) and an example of how scientific skills could be utilized to analyze and solve problems using scientific discovery. The second is a long-term study I created and described in order to keep track of and learn more about a small forest glade habitat near my parent's house.</p>
