    <h1>Learning Outcome 9: Environmental Biology Connections</h1>
    <!-- communicating about the environment, matching message to media, writing & journaling, drawing & painting, photos & videos, mixed media, science stories, generational learning -->
    <p>Environmental biology connections emphasize why it's important to communicate about the environment through experiential, creative, and educational means. The first piece to show this is a drawing I made to show the what food and nutrients move through a pond food web. The second is good practicing about communication about the environment where I think how I would go about teaching high schoolers about ozone depletion. And the final is a little science story I wrote to distill the process of bee pollination in a more engaging and interesting way. </p>
