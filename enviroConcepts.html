    <h1>Learning Outcome 7: Environmental Biology Concepts</h1>
    <!-- sustainability, conservation, stewardship, climate change, endangered species, invasive species, energy sources, human impacts, pollution, recycling, crop organisms, soil food webs, mitigation -->
    <p>Environment biology concepts focus on understanding and addressing the relationship between living organisms and their environment. The first two pieces I have chosen tell an interesting story. The first is a long term plan to acquire and take proper care of a river otter, the second is a description of why they are an important keystone species. I think this steps on an interesting note about conservation, sustainability, and stewardship which is just because you have the extreme resources to own a river otter, doesn't mean you should. They are an important species in not letting kelp forests become endangered which has many downstream impacts. The third piece is a description of how to manage endangered populations we want to help using red foxes as an example.</p>
